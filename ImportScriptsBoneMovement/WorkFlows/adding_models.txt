Collsiion shapes that follow a bone controlled mesh 
 (Manually)
	1. Add Child to Skeleton3D - BoneAttachment3D
		1a. BoneAttachment3D Inspector - Find the Bone Name parameter and 
			select the bone that controls the mesh.
		1b. Add Child to BoneAttachment3D - PhysicalBone3D
			1b1. PhysicalBone3D Inspector - Find the Bone Name parameter and
				select the bone that controls the mesh.
	2. Select the mesh and in viewer click mesh > Create Trimesh Static Body
		2a. Move the CollisionShape3D to be a child of PhysicalBone3D
		2b. Delete the StaticBody3D child from the mesh
 (Scripts)
	1. Select model e.g. BlockPerson.glft
	2. On Import tab > Import Script > Path Select res://Scripts/Utils/post_import_add_BA3D_collisions.gd
	3. Reimport, this will also save a tscn file wtih the file name of the gltf e.g. BlockPerson.tscn

Adding Detection Sphere
	1. Open AddDetectionSphere.tscn
	2. Drag the gltf file to be modified to the Scene property in the Inspector
	3. Click the Update checkbox property in the Inspector, this will save a new
		file with the name of the tscn with addition too _DA in the file name,
		you can rename it later, the script will not overwrite during execution.
	4. Add a script
	5. With the DetectionArea3d node selected, connect the appropriate signals in
		the Node>signals tab, Note that if you have prebuilt signal functions in 
		the script it will reattach the signals to those functions, it even works
		in multi-tier Class chains e.g if GoodGuy class inherits Person class and 
		the signal function is in Person, the signal will reattach to the Person Class.
		So in this case func _on_detection_area_3d_body_entered(p_body): already 
		in cBlockPerson.gd will be connected and not overwritten.
	* Note you may need to use the advanced slider in the concect signal interface
		to get it to connect to the parent class.
